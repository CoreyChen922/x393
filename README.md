FPGA code for Elphel 393 camera, created with [VDT plugin](https://github.com/Elphel/vdt-plugin)

Branch ```master``` includes the code that is simulated and tested with the NC393 hardware as described in the blog post about the [multichannel memory controller](http://blog.elphel.com/2015/05/nc393-development-progress-multichannel-memory-controller-for-the-multi-sensor-camera/).

Branch ```adding_sensors``` is the current development branch that is not yet simulated, synthesized or tested.
